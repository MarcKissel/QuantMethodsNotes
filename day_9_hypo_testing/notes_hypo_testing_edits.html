##types of logical reasoning 

Induction - from specific observations to broader generalizations 

Deduction - from general to specifics (top-down)

###research hypotheses - a substantive &amp; testable scientific claim. so a claim about human evolution/behavior/etc

###Statistical hypotheses - mathematical precise &amp; correspond to specific claims about the characteristics of the data generating mechanism

##we  want to map our **research hypothesis** onto our **stats hypothesis**

---

.center[
example: my research hypothesis is that brain size increases
          my statistical hypothesis is that Ѳ!= .5
]

#A statistical hypothesis test is a test of the statistical hypothesis, *not* the research hypothesis
          

---

#step 2
________

## figure out your **null hypothesis**:

lets say my null will be that brain size stays the same with a hominin species, so Ѳ = .5

I then go about trying to show that this null hypothesis is wrong!

we assume the null  is true unless we can prove otherwise


|keep null|reject null
-|-|-
null is true|correct|type 1 error
null is false|type 2 error|correct


---

##Want to control the probability of a Type 1 error, which is labeled as α. Why? if someone is innocent we don't want to send them to jail..

## but we want to keep both α and β small


|keep null|reject null
-|-|-
null is true|1 -α (correct retention) |α
null is false|β	|1- β	(power)

#Test statistic and sampling dist

###let's imagine we want to test for ESP.



###in a small group think about how you can do this:

## - what would be the sci hypothesis and the statisitcl hypothesis
## - What is the null

## - what problems might you run into



---

###null = no ESP. if null is true, what do we expect? 

####50 people get right? or 57? 99? 8?

### have a quantity X that we can calculate by looking at our data; after looking at the value of X, we make a decision about whether to believe that the null hypothesis is correct, or to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This is the **test statistic**

##What values of the test stat would cause us to reject the null?


---

# We ask what the **sampling distribution of the test statistic** would be if the null hypothesis were actually true


### in this  case, this is a binomial

##X ~ Binomial (Ѳ,N)

###N = 100
##for null, Ѳ = .5

???
: The sampling distribution for our test statistic  X
  when the null hypothesis is true. For our ESP scenario, this is a binomial distribution. Not surprisingly, since the null hypothesis says that the probability of a correct response is  
θ=.5
 , the sampling distribution says that the most likely value is 50 (our of 100) correct responses. Most of the probability mass lies between 40 and 60.

---

#Critical regions and critical values
 
##What values of the test statistic *X* should lead us to reject the null?

## **critical region**  corresponds to  values of X that would lead us to reject null hypothesis

 - X should be very big or very small in order to reject the null hypothesis.
 

 - If α = 05, the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution.


---

![](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/lsr_files/figure-html/crit2-1.png)

the critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the tails of the distribution

---

All that we have to do now is calculate the value of the test
statistic for the real data (e.g., X = 62) and then compare it to the critical values to make our decision. Since 62 is greater than the critical value of 60, we would reject the null hypothesis. Or, to phrase it
slightly differently, we say that the test has produced a significant result.

---

## one-sided vs. two-sided test

![](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/lsr_files/figure-html/crit1-1.png)

# P-values


value of α|reject null?
-|-|-
 .05|Yes
 .04|Yes
 .03|Yes
 .02|NO
 .01|NO

In our example, p-value = .021


### p can be defined as the smallest Type I error rate (α) that you have to be willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis.

p ≤ α then reject
P &gt; α not reject
  
or, we can define it like this:

###The probability that we would have observed a test statistic that is at least as extreme as the one we actually did get. If the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong.

---

both defs are ok
________


#What is wrong is if you say p value is "the probability that the null hypothesis is true".

no no no no



---

lets try in R


```r
binom.test( x =  62, n=100, p = .5)
```

```
## 
## 	Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  62 and 100
## number of successes = 62, number of trials = 100, p-value =
## 0.02098
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.5174607 0.7152325
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##                   0.62
```

#what is your effect size?

we also want to minimize β. let's face it, we don't want to fail to reject when the null actually is wrong!

Stats folks talk about maximizing the power of the test.
power = 1 - β


https://istats.shinyapps.io/power/


"In plain English, statistical power is the likelihood that a study will detect an effect when there is an effect there to be detected. If statistical power is high, the probability of making a Type II error, or concluding there is no effect when, in fact, there is one, goes down."


---

#effect size
 
a way to  quantifying how **similar** the
true state of the world is to the null hypothesis. or, how big is the di difference between the true population parameters, and the parameter values that
are assumed by the null hypothesis?

difference in ES study between theta  = .51 and theta = .8

---

#lets practice

in a group come up with 4 different hypos related to anthropology. think about the sci hypo, the stat hypo, what the null and alt hypo is, what the sampling dist is, and how you might test?

---
# how do we do it in real world

##X2 tests (categorcial data)
## T-tests
#ANOVA
# regression 

---
#categorical data

x2 or 'goodness of fit"

examples 
---
## picking cards at random

research hypothesis is that people don't choose cards randomly

What would the null be here?

---

H0: All four suits are chosen with equal probability
H1: At least one of the suit-choice probabilities isn't .25

---

H0: P = p(25, 25, 25, 25)
H1: P != p(25, 25, 25, 25)

note: usually goodness of fit test all cats are = but doesn't have to be

---
test statistic
we have observed data O and probablites P...we want to measure how close O is to P..

step 1. what are the expected frequencies if null is true.

n = 200
p2(diamonds) = .25

Ei = N x Pi

could do the math or...


```r
probabilities &lt;- c(clubs = .25, diamonds = .25, hearts = .25, spades = .25)
N &lt;- 200

expected &lt;- N * probabilities
```

---
#so we want to compare the Expected vs. the Observed numb of observations



-|C|H|S|d
 Expected |Yes| | |
 observed|Yes
 difference|Yes
 .02|NO
 .01|NO

---
#in R

probabilities &lt;- c(clubs = .25, diamonds = .25, hearts = .25, spades = .25)

---

people chose more hearts and fewer clubs than the null hypothesis predicted.
but the negative number is odd...does it matter which way it devaites.
no...so we can squre


```r
#(observed - expected)^2
```

so now we can tell that when # is large it means that null made a bad prections and when num is smll it made a ood prection



```r
#(observed - expected)^2 / expected
```

each tells us how big a mistake the null made when guessing what te values would be

last step is to sum it all up


```r
#sum( (observed - expected)^2 / expected )
```

this is x^2 value. if it is small means the null was close...but how small?

SAmpling dist of the Goodness-of-Fit

- simple answer: chi-squared (X^2) distribution with k- 1 degress of freedom

- what *are* degrees of freedom!

```r
qchisq( p = .95, df = 3 )
```

```
## [1] 7.814728
```

```r
pchisq( q = 8.44, df = 3, lower.tail = FALSE )
```

```
## [1] 0.03774185
```

in r

with lsr package


```r
#goodnessOfFitTest( cards$choice_1 )
```



```r
#chisq.test( x = observed )
```

---


```r
#nullProbs &lt;- c(clubs = .2, diamonds = .3, hearts = .3, spades = .2)

#goodnessOfFitTest( x = cards$choice_1, p = nullProbs )
```



```r
#chisq.test( x = observed, p = c(.2, .3, .3, .2) )
```

#The X2 test of independence (or association)

research hypothesis is that humans and robots answer the question in different ways", how can I construct a test of the null hypothesis that humans
and robots answer the question the same way



H0: All of the following are true:
P11 = P12 (same probability of saying \puppy"),
P21 = P22 (same probability of saying \
ower"), and
P31 = P32 (same probability of saying \data").

---

Calcuatlr expected frequence


- for each of the observed counts Oij , we need to figure out what the
null hypothesis would tell us to expect.

Therefore, our expected frequency can be written as the product (i.e. multiplication) of the row total
and the column total, divided by the total number of observations

# comparing two means

What if we want to compare  whetere an outcome varibae is higher in one group or another


---
# z- test (not really used, but useful when thinking about t-tests etc)

z stat = it's equal to the number
of standard errors that separate the observed sample mean X from the population mean mu predicted by the null hypothesis. Better yet, regardless of what the population parameters for the raw scores actually
are, the 5% critical regions for z-test are always the same, as illustrated in Figure 13.3. And what this
meant, way back in the days where people did all their statistics by hand, is that someone could publish
a table like this:
