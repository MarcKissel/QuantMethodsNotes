# How do we record/store/view data in a way that allows us to use it in the future

## Best advice i can give you is to think of yourself as your own co-author, looking at the data 1 year from today

# **Spreadsheets**
______________
]

## Interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form. Table of cells arranged into rows and columns. A cell = box that holds data [source: Wikipedia].   

###- Columns represented by letters, "A", "B", "C"
###- Rows represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, 

## Difference between spreadsheet and a database?

# Problems with Spreadsheets


## - Panko (2008) reported that in 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets, an average of 88% contained errors

## - In general, fine for storing data bu not so great for analyzing/visualizing data

## - Almost everyone uses them, though, and hard to get around it

## - People like to hate on Excel. Yet it is pretty standard in business and research

# Excel horror stories
 
## - Excel can turn gene names [into dates!](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)

# So why do we use them?

# Jenny Bryan's interview
__________________________
## - solves a lot of practical problems 

## - come preinstalled

## - does file organization for you

## - reactive 

## - for many, it is totes fine to use

## - but if you do data analysis it can get annoying

# Dates
___________________
## storing dates is very tricky. Most like the YYYY-MM-DD format. 

## Excel stores dates as a number that says how many days have passed since a given date. But that *given date* isn't always the same!

# Excel can do some really strange things with dates

# don't leave cells open 
_______________________

## Instead, places with no info should have NA

# make backups and save data as plain text
__________________________________
# - learn how to  write-protect a file
# - backup often to Google Drive
# - do data analysis on a  **copy** of the data
# - save it as a .csv or other text file

???
• On a Mac, right-click on the le in Finder and select \Get Info". In the menu
that opens, there is a section at the bottom on \Sharing &amp; Permissions". Click on
\Privilege" for yourself and select \Read only".
• In Windows, right-click on the le in Windows Explorer and select \Properties". In
the \General" tab, there is a section at the bottom with \Attributes". Select the box
for \Read-only" and click the \OK" button.

## Great feature of spreadsheets!

# Text editors
_________________
]
### - Get used to looking at data though a text editor, which views plain text, rather than a spreadsheet

###- I tend to use Notepad, but there are [many other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors)

### - one example of a CSV editor is [**Data Curator**](https://theodi.org.au/data-curator/)

# Class work, part 1:]

##Now it is time to put what we talked about into practice. Everyone is going to get two objects that have candy in them. **Without talking to anyone else** i want you to create a spreadsheet of the *data* you have. Can use any spreadsheet program or do it on a piece of paper. 

#Answer the questions on the handout. Then put the candy back in the eggs and/or eat the candy!

if you have time, calculate some summary stats (mean, median, etc) if you know how to. if not, no worries :)

# Class work, part 2:]

##Now, get into groups of 3. Share your data in the group and try to pool the data into one larger spreadsheet. 

##Questions

## 1. Was it easy to pool the data
## 2. what problems did you have
## 3. what might you do differently if you started with all the data

# Now, create a new spreadsheet that works best for the data. Make sure it fits with the rules we discussed before


---
#next week:

# look online and research/learn about one other spreadsheet besides Excel or Google sheets. 

# try it out with some data (real or fake)
# take notes on what you learned about it. does it seem good. what are the pluses and minuses 

---
#install R and R-Studio
